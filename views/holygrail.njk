                    The holy grail is a web page layout which has multiple, equal height columns that are defined with
                    style sheets. It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in which
                    it could be implemented with available technologies all had drawbacks. Because of this, finding an
                    optimal implementation was likened to searching for the elusive Holy Grail. </p>
                <p>
                    More recent web standards have provided much more complete and robust solutions for implementing
                    this layout. In particular, the CSS Flexible Box Layout and CSS Grid Layout modules have both
                    provided full solutions. We are using the CSS Flexible Box Layout to make this possible.
